# Project Structure

## Backend
- **app/**: Contains the FastAPI application
  - **main.py**: Entry point for the FastAPI app
  - **services/**: Business logic and service classes
  - **models/**: Data models and schemas
  - **routes/**: API route definitions

## Frontend
- **frontend/**: Contains the web-based UI components
  - **src/**: Source files for the frontend
  - **dist/**: Compiled frontend assets

## Chrome Extension
- **extension/**: Contains the Chrome extension files
  - **manifest.json**: Configuration file for the Chrome extension
  - **popup.html**: HTML for the extension's popup interface
  - **popup.js**: JavaScript for handling popup interactions
  - **content.js**: Script injected into web pages to interact with the DOM
  - **background.js**: JavaScript for background processes

## Voice Recognition
- Will be handled in `voice_processor.py`

## AI Processing
- Will be handled in `ai_processor.py`

## Real-time Communication
- WebSocket implementation in `server.py`

## Redlining Functionality
- Will be handled in `redline_generator.py`

## Additional Directories and Files
- `/tests`
  - `/unit`: For unit tests
  - `/integration`: For integration tests
- `/data`: For any necessary data files
- `/requirements`: For dependency management
- `.env`: Contains environment variables (including Groq API key)
- `.gitignore`: To exclude sensitive files from version control

## Security Considerations
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) in manifest.json
- Implement HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use secure storage for sensitive data in Chrome extension

## Next Steps
1. Set up the basic Chrome extension structure with security best practices
2. Implement a basic Python server with WebSocket support
3. Set up unit and integration test frameworks
4. Integrate voice recognition functionality
5. Develop AI processing capabilities using Groq API
6. Implement redlining functionality
7. Connect all components and ensure real-time communication
8. Conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, and security tests)
9. Refine and optimize the extension

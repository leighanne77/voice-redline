# Roadmap for Voice-Redline Project

## Current Status

For content.js: The script now works with Google Docs and Microsoft Office Online by manipulating the DOM elements directly. However, please note that this approach may need further refinement depending on the specific structure of these online document editors.

## Future Improvements

1. Refine DOM manipulation for better compatibility with Google Docs and Microsoft Office Online
2. Implement specific adapters for each supported platform to handle their unique structures
3. Enhance real-time collaboration features
4. Optimize performance for large documents
5. Implement multi-language support for real-time translation
6. Develop more advanced AI-powered suggestion capabilities
7. Improve voice command recognition accuracy
8. Enhance security measures for handling sensitive documents
9. Create a more user-friendly interface for the Chrome extension
10. Implement automated testing for various document types and platforms

This roadmap will be updated as the project progresses and new priorities are identified.
